## 🎯 Game Concept  
The dead have risen, and the world you once knew is gone.  
You awaken in a desolate environment crawling with the undead. Your resources are few, your enemies are many, and your time is running out.  

To survive, you must:  
- **Explore** the world for ammo, light sources, and other resources.  
- **Defend** yourself against waves of fast, aggressive zombies.  
- **Conserve** every bullet — waste nothing.  
- **Outsmart** the undead using movement, cover, and tactics.  

If they catch you… there’s no coming back.
